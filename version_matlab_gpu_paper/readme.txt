The script "script_M_algorithm_gpu.m" tries to obtain a binary 2-separating
ccode through the GPU version of the M-algorithm described in the paper. The
desired dimensions (M,n) of the code are set at the beginning of the script. 
In this version, a maximum of 100 resamples are performed; if the resulting
 code is not 2-separating, the program stops.

This version is quite similar to the matlab basic version (folder "version_matlab_paper").
