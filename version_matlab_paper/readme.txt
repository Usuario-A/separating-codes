The script "script_M_algorithm_matlab.m" tries to obtain a binary 2-separating
ccode through a matlab imlementation of the M-algorithm described in the paper. The desired dimensions (M,n) 
of the code are set at the beginning of the script. In this version, a maximum of
100 resamples are performed. If the resulting code is not 2-separating, the program stops.
